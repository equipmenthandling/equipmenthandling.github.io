<h2>Truck Mounted Forklifts Sterling </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things to consider about how your truck will change after it's lifted. At Leson Chevrolet, we pride ourselves on being your lifted truck dealership in the Harvey and New Orleans area.
