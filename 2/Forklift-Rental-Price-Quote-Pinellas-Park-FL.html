<p>Powered industrial trucks can either be ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator. Generally, the smallest capacity cushion available, the 3,000 lb. is a light-duty truck ideal for warehouses and production lines. A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>

Additionally, regular maintenance is necessary for gas forklifts to prevent breakdowns. Counterbalance forklifts are available in 4-wheel and 3-wheel configuration.

These are classifications of six commonly-used types of forklifts, as recognized by OSHA, along with different types of trucks unique to each class. We stand behind all of the forklifts we rent to our clients, ensuring that each piece of machinery not only achieves peak performance, but also adheres to stringent California emissions requirements.</p>

If your truck is lifted, or if you're getting ready to have a lift kit installed, make sure you're aware of all the potential safety and handling implications that are associated with the additional height and hardware.

<p>This forklift has a three-wheel variant that allows the operator to turn and maneuver in circles. Almost all counterbalanced powered industrial trucks have a three-point suspension system. If you will be renting a charger with your rental equipment, there are many factors to consider. We are your full service provider for new and used forklifts, rentals, parts, service, warehousing, racking, and lift truck operator training.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
