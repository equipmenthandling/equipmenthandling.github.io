<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

Many lifted truck stores put lifts on high mile trucks, and this can lead to a poor ride and other issues that are associated with lifted vehicles. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>

The Raymond High-capacity Reach-Fork truck integrates telematics capabilities to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>Both Gasoline engine type and LP gas engine type have stronger power, hence suitable for heavy goods cargo work, while Electric and fuel cell types have zero emission and great quietness, which are more suitable for in-warehouse work.
