<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. When it comes to washing a lifted truck (or anything listed for that matter) being able to spray soap on the surface as opposed to applying in by hand is really your best bet for washing quickly.

<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>We offer Forklifts, Cranes and other Heavy equipments on rental contracts across all industrial sectors like FMCG, Logistics, Warehouse, Manufacturing Industries and many more. KION Group is the other major material handling company in Germany, and they have even stronger sales than Jungheinrich. You've seen the big ol' monster trucks on TV, laying waste to everything they drive over.</p>

<p>We carry new and used forklifts in every major make and model. Our Fork Lift Rental fleet is regularly updated with New Rental Equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications.

Three-wheel forklift trucks also have models where the operator can either sit down or just stand while operating the truck.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
