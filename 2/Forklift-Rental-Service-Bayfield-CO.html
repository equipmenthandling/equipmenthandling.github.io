Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform.

<p>Space the fork evenly from the center stringer of the pallet to balance the load. You would have to determine whether or not you are operating on a ramp, how heavy the load is, the kind of condition the pallet truck is in, and the distance you have to cover. If you've bought it from a store, it was probably lifted from its place on the shelf by a worker many feet in the air with an order picker forklift.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction because in order to install a lift kit, the truck's body and frame must be separate. We have seen that business owners who use a hand pallet truck give much productivity per day.
