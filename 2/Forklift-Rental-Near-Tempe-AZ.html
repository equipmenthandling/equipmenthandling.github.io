The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>All hydraulic functions can be controlled using proportional finger tips for precise and safe load handling. Most warehouses in the United States use counterbalance forklifts to move products, manage inventory, and improve efficiency for all sorts of cargo-related tasks.
