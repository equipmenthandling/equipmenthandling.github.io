<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.

<h2>Fork Truck Accidents And Forklift Health And Safety Carpentersville </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>

The counterbalance‚Äù term refers to the weight distribution for cargo loads; any pallets or merchandise are counterbalanced against the weight of the machine. Forklifts vary in brand, size and purpose. Ask a mechanic to check the forklift for potential problems that you have identified or might have overlooked.</p>

Load Capacity or Rated Operating Capacity refers to how much weight the pallet jack can safely lift. Most warehouse forklift types can carry 5,000 lbs, though heavy-duty models can manage even heavier loads.</p>
