<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires.

Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions.

Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>Do not exceed the load limit of any type of powered industrial truck, especially a forklift. Create sales material to present to customers. In the Guru, when referring to overall width for class 2 & 3 trucks, overall width refers to the width of the power unit, not the outriggers. Rent equipment online to access exclusive web rates on all your rentals. Be sure you are selecting the right forklift for your intended application and weight loads.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved.

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company.
