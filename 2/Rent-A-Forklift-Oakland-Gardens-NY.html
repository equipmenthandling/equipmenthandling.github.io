Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>

<p>The complexity of the operator controls, the caution with which trucks much be operated and the care required in moving heavy and sometimes precarious loads are all elements of risk with fork lift truck use. Today I'll share a few of these tips I've come across to make washing your lifted truck or SUV a little easier. Well, it's an attention-getting hook; see, the pair of H1s are converted into hybrids and are actually very clean running trucks.</p>

<p>Further, the association also contribute to training the forklift operators as per the regulations imposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to reduce accidents. That's the first time more than a quarter-million units were sold in one year in North America, according to Brian Feehan, president of the Industrial Truck Association, the trade group representing lift truck manufacturers.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification.

Prominently display the official OSHA Job Safety and Health - It's the Law poster 15 that describes rights and responsibilities under the OSH Act.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
