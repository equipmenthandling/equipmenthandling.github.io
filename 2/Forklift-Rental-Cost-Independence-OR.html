<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers.

In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>

<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them.

Body lifts can increase the height of a truck by up to three inches and can allow for larger tires on the truck. A "lifted truck" is a truck whose suspension has been modified to accommodate larger tires, usually 35 inches or bigger.</p>
