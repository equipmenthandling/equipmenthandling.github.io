When it comes to washing a lifted truck (or anything listed for that matter) being able to spray soap on the surface as opposed to applying in by hand is really your best bet for washing quickly. Material handling is an essential business. As an operator of a counterbalance forklift, you could find yourself in many different types of workplaces; from constructions sites to ports, warehouses, storage yards and factories.</p>

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
