Our guide covers the most popular forklift types and the best uses for each, so you can make a well-informed, confident decision on which is the best forklift for your specific warehouse and its needs. All employees who work in the area should be familiar with the unique hazards associated with pallet jacks and the safe work practices expected in the workplace.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>Moreover, the demand for the electric lift truck is witnessed majorly across the North America region and is also projected to grow in the same propaganda for the forecast period. In either case, a repair can be difficult if the forklift is stranded on rough terrain. Extendable fork: An extra long fork makes it possible for a narrow aisle forklift double stack pallets, one in front of the other.</p>
