<p>Suitable for indoor horizontal transportation and stacking, such as in warehouses, distribution centers and logistics companies, the Toyota range of powerful reach trucks offers high acceleration and exceptional drivability for optimum pallet movement.

Regardless of the brand name, you should expect to find an engine capable of at least 74 to 78 hp on the lower end (straight mast forklifts) and up to 142 hp on the high end (encompassing telehandlers with extended reach capability).</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>
