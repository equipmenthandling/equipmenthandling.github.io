<p>The full line of Yale robotic lift trucks uses infrastructure-free navigation technology, which requires no installation of wires, magnets or tape. The ZR2 has increased clearance, a transfer case shield, front frame-mounted tow hooks, and 17-inch wheels with Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac maximum traction tires. There are different sized forklifts and you'll have to determine if you want a smaller or bigger sized equipment to handle all of the lifting.</p>
<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
<p>With the Operator Presence Sensing (OPS) System, the reach truck becomes inoperative when the floor switch cannot detect the driver.
