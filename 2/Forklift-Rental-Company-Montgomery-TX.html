On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option. Cushion-tired lifts tend to ride lower to the ground than pneumatic-tired forklifts, making this type of forklift well-suited to low-clearance situations. Different types of tyres are available for forklifts. According to a TICO representative, the materials handling equipment market as a whole continued to expand globally due mainly to increases in unit sales in Europe and North America as well as a recovery in China, although unit sales in Japan were on par with the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>
