Lifted truck up-fits are either for utility, such as enhancing your truck's capabilities and performance, or to improve its appearance.

The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
