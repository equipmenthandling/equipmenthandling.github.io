<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<h2>Nissan Lift Trucks Tinley Park</h2>
<p>Platform slope value of 14 percent applies to trucks with single rear wheel drive (or brake), and 18 percent applies to trucks with dual rear wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.

<h3>Forklift Suppliers Tinley Park IL</h3>
<p>Especially for off-roaders, constant stress to the shocks when going over large rocks or hitting deep potholes can cause your shocks to stiffen up and stop absorbing suspension. Rent a telescopic forklift, Heli forklift, LPG forklift and warehouse forklift - for forklift rental in the San Antonio TX, Seguin, New Braunfels, Universal City, Schertz, San Marcos, Lockhart and Live Oak Texas areas.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you make a good sound and informed decision to ensure that you purchase the right forklift for the job within your desired budget. However, lifting provides many advantages for off-road use, including greater approach, breakover, and departure angles. Counterbalance forklifts have no extending arms, giving them the ability to move directly to the load.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
