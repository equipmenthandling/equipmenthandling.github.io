Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.

Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
