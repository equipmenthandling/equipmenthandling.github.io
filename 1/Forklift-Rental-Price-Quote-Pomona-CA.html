<p>Powered industrial trucks, commonly called forklifts or lift trucks, are used in many industries, primarily to move materials. We have a team of sales executives that are responsible for offering product information on our wide range of new Heli forklifts. Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we offer our customers the possibility of covering their machinery damage with STILL Rental Plus. This is the total amount of weight the forklift can move off the ground.

The ZR2 has increased clearance, a transfer case shield, front frame-mounted tow hooks, and 17-inch wheels with Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac maximum traction tires. There are different sized forklifts and you'll have to determine if you want a smaller or bigger sized equipment to handle all of the lifting.</p>

While these two lift kits are somewhat similar, there are important differences between them. This will provide them with the necessary certifications to be able to use forklifts legally in their job. Even if you specified you would need the rental for a specific amount of time, i.e. 2 days, it is the renters responsibility to make sure the equipment is returned.</p>
