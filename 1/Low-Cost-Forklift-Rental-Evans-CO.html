<p>If you are new to buying a forklift, carefully consider what type of forklift you need. Our expertise lies in a consultative approach to providing the best value-for-money forklift solution available to suit your needs. Double-deep trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks, and they are ideal for warehouses where a lot of pallet loads are stored in each bay.</p>

The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
