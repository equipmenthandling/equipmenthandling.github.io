Ahern specializes in high reach equipment, which permits the safe lifting of people or materials to work at height.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>

<p>Our ranges of products like Standard Hand Hydraulic Pallet Truck are designed and developed using advanced technology and superior quality raw material. In the electric forklift, the battery acts partially as a counterweight which saves space. Designed to automatically lock the pallet for a secure grip, the Automatic Pallet Grip feature provides optimum control of the load.</p>
