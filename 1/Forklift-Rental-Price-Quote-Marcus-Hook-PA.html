ProControl Account Management by Herc Rentals comes with tools to make your job easier, faster and more rewarding. Narrow aisle forklifts like walkie stackers and side loaders can measure less than 5 ft. However, if you are using a forklift in a warehouse setting, it is important to consider the aisle width.</p>

Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts.
