Failure to secure truck or trailer with blocks can cause the trailer to move resulting in the forklift falling between the trailer and the dock. First, take the time to train your whole crew to use rough terrain forklifts. The Air Lift compressor will mount onto your vehicle's frame while you will run the air line tubing from the compressor to your air springs.</p>

Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.

With solutions for indoor and outdoor operations, warehouse and distribution centers to rugged terrain applications, we have the right forklift for your business when you need it.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
