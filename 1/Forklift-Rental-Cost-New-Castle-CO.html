The Company offers forklifts, lift trucks, dumpers, compactors, screeds, trowels, and telehandlers, as well as repairs and maintenance services.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.
