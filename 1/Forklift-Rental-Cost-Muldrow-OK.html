That piece of equipment is known as the pallet jack It is possibly one of the most versatile, durable and useful pieces of material handling equipment available.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients.

Sit-down Forklift and Rider Pallet Jack experience is helpful. Workplace type and conditions are also factors in hazards commonly associated with powered industrial trucks. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
