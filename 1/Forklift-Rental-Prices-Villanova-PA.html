<h3>New, Used, Or Rental Forklifts Villanova PA 19085</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>Still, gas forklifts are more popular for many outdoors jobs. Compact and high powered reach trucks of 1.3ton up to 2.5ton capacity offer fast response, easy operation and smooth load handling for high-density warehouse handling efficiency. Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
