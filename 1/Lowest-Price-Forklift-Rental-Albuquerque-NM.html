<p>Forklift on hire you can find on heavy equipments. Other forklifts raise the operator with the forks, or are operated from a standing position.

Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets.</p>
<p>Instead, pump trucks rely on good old-fashioned manual labor as the operator pumps‚Äù the jack to lift the skids with their own force. Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements.

It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
<p>Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps.
