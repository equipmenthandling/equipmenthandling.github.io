<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Non-serious injuries related to forklift accidents reach 61,800 each year in the USA. In my region, paper mills call them tow motors,” warehouses may refer to them as stackers,” and builders tend to use telehandlers” in lieu of rough terrain forklifts.” OSHA uses the all-encompassing phrase powered industrial trucks,” or PITs, when referring to forklifts in its 1910.178 standard.</p>

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.
