<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>Outfit your shop with confidence, knowing that Gray jacks and Gray lifts are some of the best jacking and lifting products on the market and backed not only by a manufacturer lifetime warranty but also quick and convenient repairs from Ohio Power Tool. A suspension lift is a more popular option and gives you more ground clearance than a body lift - it's the only way to get enough height for larger tires.</p>

<p>But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts. The North American electric truck market grew 6%, whereas the IC market was down 5%. The IC decline was almost entirely centered on Class 4, indoor cushion tire equipment, which fell 11% as Class 5 remained flat. Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>
