Material handling is an essential business. As an operator of a counterbalance forklift, you could find yourself in many different types of workplaces; from constructions sites to ports, warehouses, storage yards and factories.</p>

Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners. Compare that to any other body style of any car or truck from the ‘90s and it looks outdated and ugly.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required.
