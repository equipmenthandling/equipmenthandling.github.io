Whether you need to move heavy loads in a warehouse or construction field, forklifts can safely lift objects humans cannot, making them indispensable on any job site.

<p>Rider jack is a pallet truck that has a small platform for an operator to stand on during the transportation, which excludes walking. If you need to rent a forklift in Virginia , South Carolina , or North Carolina , look no further than Gregory Poole, your trusted source of material handling equipment and warehousing solutions.

Forklift rentals are not inexpensive.</p>
<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>You will commonly see these lift trucks used at construction sites to transport and lift building materials. Lift and tow heavy or extremely large loads efficiently and safely in rough terrain environments with power and precision.
