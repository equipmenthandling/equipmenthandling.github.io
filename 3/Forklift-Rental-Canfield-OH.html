<h3>Counterbalance Forklift Canfield OH</h3>
<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines.

<p>Sit down forklift has a seat for a rider which faces the mast. At Lifted Trucks Only we like to say that we are in the business of making automotive dreams a reality. You will work around and use moving machines, such as stand-up forklifts, turret trucks, order pickers, and mobile carts. Our products come with some of the industry's best warranties to protect your investment, plus we provide 24-hour emergency service.</p>
<p>Driving such a mess would be grounds for ridicule and a reminder that the driver is a low-class yokel redneck from the uncultured fly-over states. Keep in mind that forklift rentals aren't the only warehouse equipment leases we'll do - floor cleaning equipment, personnel carriers, burden carriers and more are all available to rent out. Rough-terrrain lifts are particularly prone to abuse if they were employed at a construction site.</p>
