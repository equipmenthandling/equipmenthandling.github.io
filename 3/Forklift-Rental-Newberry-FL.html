<h2>What You Need To Know About Forklift Masts in Newberry </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>Unlike most other companies in the equipment rental space, Herc Rentals offers a number of tools along with their tractors and forklifts. Our hand pallet truck steering wheels in Nylon and PU are available in the markets with the customization facilities to cater to the ever changing needs of clients. You can get a lifted truck at home with a lift kit, have it done professionally, or buy a truck that is already lifted.</p>
<p>Our range of Super Short Hand Pallet Truck is scientifically designed to achieve maximum production capacity with minimum human efforts. These types of forklifts are faster and much more powerful than electric forklifts, but are also much louder. Agria forklifts are fitted with industry leading Deutz or Perkins diesel engines to provide the extra power necessary to operate over rough terrain whilst carrying heavy loads.</p>

<p>At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.

Integral sideshift allows sideways movement of the forks to handle loads that may not be aligned with the truck.
