Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision.

<p>The cost to rent a narrow aisle forklift is roughly $200 to $300 per day, $400 to $500 per week, and $1,000 to $1,500 per month. These machines can also navigate fields, pastures, pens, and loading areas.
