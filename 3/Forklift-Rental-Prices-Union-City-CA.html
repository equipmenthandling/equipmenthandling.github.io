<p>A rental can also serve as a test drive,” allowing you to test out different types of equipment to determine what you want to purchase.

Apart from this, a feedback of the spec sheet for Jungheinrich's 5000 lb. Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>
