The Rocky Ridge K2 package includes a 6-inch suspension lift, custom fender flares, 20-inch custom wheels, 35-inch all-terrain tires, and Rocky Ridge exclusive stealth-coated grille and bumpers.</p>
<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials.
