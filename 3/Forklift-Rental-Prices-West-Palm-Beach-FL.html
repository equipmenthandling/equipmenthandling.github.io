<p>If you have ever ridden in, or driven a lowered truck, you are well aware of that lifted Super Duty coming up from behind with the headlights shining clear above your cab and lighting up the night sky ahead of you, as if you had a roof-mounted lightbar attached to your road grater. Suspension lift kits are completely different from body kits in terms of structure.</p>
<p>The machine known as a stockpicker is an electric forklift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads.
