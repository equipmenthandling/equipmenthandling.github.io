<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
<h2>How Forklifts Work Astoria </h2>
<p>These sit-down rough terrain forklifts have all been checked upon purchase to determine that they are in good working order. The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required. When a 15,500 lb. forklift isn't enough, you'll need a high-capacity cushion forklift to get the job done.</p>

Longitudinal stability isn't the only concern for lift truck operators. This is a lifting aid that you can adjust to your requirements, ensuring an efficient workflow, safe for both operators and goods.</p>

<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating.

<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up.

Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
