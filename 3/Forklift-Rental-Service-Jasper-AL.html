Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts.

Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires.
