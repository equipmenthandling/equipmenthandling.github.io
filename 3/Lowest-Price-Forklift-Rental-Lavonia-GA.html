We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>
<h2>Pallet Lift Equipment Lavonia </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>

<h2>Industrial Lift Truck Lavonia</h2>
<p>Many rough terrain forklifts come with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive options. And one of the biggest barriers to making your warehouse work for you is the forklifts you have at your disposal. Use: Most commonly used forklift in the U.S. Primarily used indoors in warehouse type operations, good for use on smooth surfaces only. Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Provides references that may aid in recognizing hazards associated with powered industrial trucks and provides examples of possible solutions. If you see yourself going on frequent off-road adventures, a suspension lift will be beneficial. In order to be able to pick up heavy loads at the front, a forklift has to be even heavier at the back. They have over 60 years of experience in equipment rental.</p>
<p>If your warehouse is stocked full of pallets, a warehouse forklift is an efficient way to carefully load and remove balanced inventory from industrial shelving. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
