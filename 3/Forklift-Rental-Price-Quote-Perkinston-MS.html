<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>There are even lifted truck interest groups and clubs, which are excellent sources of information about the best local deals on these vehicles. Industrial Counterbalanced Forklift trucks have been used since the 1960's to aid in the transportations of heavy warehousing materials over short distances and heights. In addition to being exclusively powered by diesel engines, Class VII forklifts are available in two-wheel and four-wheel drive versions.</p>

Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>
<p>Average forklifts for everyday usage start at a lift height of eight feet and go all the way up to 20 feet, but there are units that reach far above those levels. 55. 55 Rule: Employees will not place any part of their bodies outside the running lines of an industrial truck or between mast uprights or other parts of the truck where shear or crushing hazards exist.</p>
