<p>It comprises all types of electric pallet trucks, forklift trucks, order pickers, reach trucks, tow tractors, tow train trailers and shuttle vehicles. An electric pallet jack is a pallet jack powered by batteries contained inside the pallet jack. All pedestrian operated trucks have forks that slide beneath the pallet and use a hydraulic jack to lift the load from the ground for easy manoeuvrability.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
